[x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
If you wanted to have state in the component and not just read props.

[x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

1. componentDidMount
   Will execute when the component is first mounted
2. componentDidUpdate
   Will execute when there is a change to props or state.
3. componentWillUnmount
   Will execute when the component is removed from the DOM

[x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
To allow us the ability to extract logic (non-visual ) behavior. This allows us to share logic between functions.

[x] Why is it important to test our apps?
Testing is essential to provide confidence in the logic and functionality of the application. It allows us to update our applications, add new features and functionality while assuring that our code remains intact and sound in the process. Testing is an essential part of a developer's toolbox, as it provides a way to limit any bugs and account for edge user cases. Through testing, we can follow a user through our application and ensure they have the intended expereince.
